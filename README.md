# TechHaven Analysis
TechHaven is a trusted e-store established in 2018 that focuses on being the one stop shop for electronics globally. TechHaven generated **$28M with over 108K sales** in 2019-2022. However, TechHaven has encountered competition which has affected KPIs since Covid-19. With a large amount of data on sales, orders, refunds, geographic information, and the loyalty program, I am partnering with the Head of Operations to thoroughly analyze this information to uncover insights and provide recommendations to improve company growth.
