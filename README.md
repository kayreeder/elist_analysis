# TechHaven Analysis
TechHaven is a trusted e-store established in 2018 that focuses on being the one stop shop for electronics globally. TechHaven generated **$28M with over 108K sales** in 2019-2022. However, TechHaven has encountered competition which has affected KPIs since Covid-19. With a large amount of data on sales, orders, refunds, geographic information, and the loyalty program, I am partnering with the Head of Operations to thoroughly analyze this information to uncover insights and provide recommendations to improve company growth.

  - The spike likely reflected **store shutdowns driving online demand**.  
- From 2019 → 2020:

  - **Order count increased by 17K**  
  - **Sales spiked by $6.3M**.

</td>

- 2022 shows **deepest declines**, suggesting renewed need for Q4 engagement strategies.

## Recommendations

<div align="center">

<table>
<tr>
<td width="48%" valign="top">

<h4>Sales Trends</h4>

- **Capitalize on seasonal peaks:**  
  Focus marketing and ad spend in **Q4 (Nov–Dec)** where TechHaven consistently sees a +22 % sales lift.  
- **Reignite mid-year activity:**  
  Introduce **summer promotions** or loyalty incentives to counteract recurring May–July slowdowns.  
- **Stabilize post-2020 decline:**  
  Diversify channel strategy and improve inventory planning to smooth year-over-year volatility.  

<h4>Product Performance</h4>

- **Reduce concentration risk:**  
  Expand mid-tier and accessory product lines to lessen dependence on top 3 SKUs.  
- **Leverage Apple halo effect:**  
  Create bundled offers (e.g., Apple device + accessory) to raise AOV while maintaining brand draw.  
- **Address underperformers:**  
  Reassess low-revenue items (e.g., webcams, older accessories) for redesign or discontinuation.  

</td>
<td width="48%" valign="top">

<h4>Refund Rates</h4>

- **Investigate 2022 data gap:**  
  Prioritize full refund data collection to confirm sustained improvement.  
- **Maintain quality initiatives:**  
  Continue QA processes and vendor audits that reduced refunds 2019–2021.  
- **Integrate refund metrics:**  
  Track refund rates as KPIs in performance dashboards to identify product issues early.  

<h4>Loyalty Program</h4>

- **Enhance engagement:**  
  Add **tiered rewards** and exclusive offers to encourage repeat purchases.  
- **Convert non-members:**  
  Target remaining non-loyal customers with incentives before key seasonal periods.  
- **Measure program ROI:**  
  Correlate CLV and AOV data to demonstrate the financial impact of loyalty growth.
