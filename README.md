# TechHaven Analysis
TechHaven is a trusted e-store established in 2018 that focuses on being the one stop shop for electronics globally. TechHaven generated **$28M with over 108K sales** in 2019-2022. However, TechHaven has encountered competition which has affected KPIs since Covid-19. With a large amount of data on sales, orders, refunds, geographic information, and the loyalty program, I am partnering with the Head of Operations to thoroughly analyze this information to uncover insights and provide recommendations to improve company growth.

## Sales Trends 
With TechHaven starting in 2018, there was not much growth the following year. However, 2020 spiked sales with a **50% growth rate in March alone.** This could be due to the shutdown of stores during that time, forcing customers to shop online. From 2019 to 2020, **AOV increased by 31% and order count by 17K.** 

However, the company could not maintain this momentum in the following years. Sales rose sharply through 2020, peaking midyear at **over $1.2M** before declining steadily across 2021 and 2022. **AOV (-10%)** and **order count (-40%)** also declined from 2021 to 2022. The linear trendline shows a gradual downward shift in overall performance after the 2020 high point. This pattern suggests an exceptional surge, possibly driven by short-term market demand or promotional factors, followed by normalization in later years.

### Seasonality
Sales consistently spike during the holiday season, with November and December driving an average of **22% growth in both revenue and order volume**, underscoring the brand’s reliance on year-end consumer activity.

Monthly growth rate trends from 2019–2022 reveal clear signs of seasonal volatility and post-2020 normalization. Across all four years, February and October consistently show **declines in sales and order count by 23-31%**, indicating potential cyclical slowdowns in customer activity or promotional gaps during these periods. The 2020 surge stands out as a sharp anomaly, with rapid early-year expansion followed by contraction in Q4. However, subsequent years show a persistent decline in growth momentum, culminating in deeper drops during 2022.

<ul>
  <li>Overall refund rates <strong>declined steadily from 2019 to 2021</strong>, suggesting improved quality control and customer satisfaction.</li>
  <li><strong>MacBook Air</strong> and <strong>ThinkPad Laptop</strong> started highest (~17–18%) but <strong>improved to single digits by 2021</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>iPhone</strong> and the <strong>27in 4K Gaming Monitor</strong> remained in a <strong>moderate</strong> range with gradual improvement.</li>
  <li>Accessories—especially <strong>Bose Headphones</strong> and <strong>Samsung Charging Cable Pack</strong>—show <strong>near-zero refunds</strong> across years.</li>
  <li>The downward trend points to <strong>higher reliability</strong>, fewer returns, and <strong>greater operational efficiency</strong>.</li>
</ul>


  <li>The **MacBook Air Laptop**, despite generating the **second-highest total revenue ($6.3 M)**, also had one of the **highest refund rates (18 % in 2019)** — suggesting that premium pricing or early model issues may have driven higher returns early on. However, steady improvement through 2021 (down to 6 %) indicates stronger quality control or customer satisfaction in later releases.  
  <li>The **ThinkPad Laptop**, a consistent top performer in order volume, showed a similar decline in refunds (17 % → 9 %), reflecting a positive reliability trend without major sales trade-offs.  
  <li>**Apple AirPods Headphones**, a high-volume product responsible for nearly **45 % of total orders**, experienced moderate refund rates (6–10 %), which remained manageable given their shipment scale — showing that high turnover didn’t compromise quality.  
  <li>The **27-in 4K Gaming Monitor** ranked among the top three revenue generators (~$9.8 M) and maintained mid-range refund rates (7–11 %), indicating that its strong performance came with acceptable product stability.  
  <li>**Lower-priced accessories**, including the **Bose Headphones** and **Samsung Charging Cable Pack**, maintained near-zero refunds throughout all years — small-ticket items that nonetheless reinforced TechHaven’s overall customer trust and low return rate profile.  
  <li>Across all categories, refunds **declined significantly from 2019 to 2021**, aligning with improved sales efficiency and fewer product-level losses — demonstrating that TechHaven’s most profitable products are also becoming more reliable year over year.
