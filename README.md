# TechHaven Analysis
TechHaven is a global e-commerce retailer established in 2018, positioned as a one-stop shop for consumer electronics. Between 2019 and 2022, the company generated over **$28M in revenue across more than 108K sales.**

In recent years, however, increased market competition, especially following the Covid-19 era, has begun to impact TechHaven’s key performance indicators (KPIs). To address this, I partnered with the Head of Operations to conduct a comprehensive analysis of company data, including sales, orders, refunds, geographic performance, and loyalty program trends.

This analysis and recommendations will be used to strengthen TechHaven’s growth strategy, enhance customer retention, and improve overall operational efficiency.

  Reevaluate weak products such as older webcams or headphones for redesign, replacement, or retirement.

</td>
<td width="48%" valign="top">

<h4>Refund Rates</h4>
