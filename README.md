# TechHaven Analysis
TechHaven is a trusted e-store established in 2018 that focuses on being the one stop shop for electronics globally. TechHaven generated **$28M with over 108K sales** in 2019-2022. However, TechHaven has encountered competition which has affected KPIs since Covid-19. With a large amount of data on sales, orders, refunds, geographic information, and the loyalty program, I am partnering with the Head of Operations to thoroughly analyze this information to uncover insights and provide recommendations to improve company growth.

## Trends 
With TechHaven starting in 2018, there was not much growth the following year. However, 2020 spiked sales with a **50% growth rate in March alone.** This could be due to the shutdown of stores during that time, forcing customers to shop online. From 2019 to 2020, **AOV increased by 31% and order count by 17K.** However, the company could not maintain this momentum in the following years. From 2021-2022, total sales, AOV, and order count dropped by **46%, 10%, and 40% respectively.**

### Seasonality
•	TechHaven sees an influx in sales every year during holiday season, averaging a **22% increase in November and 22% increase in December.** Order count increases by **23% in November and 21% in December.**
•	February and October are consistently the worst months for the company. Sales **decline on average by 23% in February and 31% in October** while order count **decreases by 25% in February and 31% in October.**
•	This provides insight into customer behavior patterns. Consumers tend to save prior to the holidays to wait for the best deals such as Black Friday. On the flip side, customers may be inclined to save after spending large during the holidays, which could contribute to the dip in sales and orders in February.
