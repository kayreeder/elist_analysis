# TechHaven Analysis
TechHaven is a trusted e-store established in 2018 that focuses on being the one stop shop for electronics globally. TechHaven generated **$28M with over 108K sales** in 2019-2022. However, TechHaven has encountered competition which has affected KPIs since Covid-19. With a large amount of data on sales, orders, refunds, geographic information, and the loyalty program, I am partnering with the Head of Operations to thoroughly analyze this information to uncover insights and provide recommendations to improve company growth.

## Sales Trends 
With TechHaven starting in 2018, there was not much growth the following year. However, 2020 spiked sales with a **50% growth rate in March alone.** This could be due to the shutdown of stores during that time, forcing customers to shop online. From 2019 to 2020, **AOV increased by 31% and order count by 17K.** 

However, the company could not maintain this momentum in the following years. Sales rose sharply through 2020, peaking midyear at **over $1.2M** before declining steadily across 2021 and 2022. **AOV (-10%)** and **order count (-40%)** also declined from 2021 to 2022. The linear trendline shows a gradual downward shift in overall performance after the 2020 high point. This pattern suggests an exceptional surge, possibly driven by short-term market demand or promotional factors, followed by normalization in later years.

### Seasonality
Sales consistently spike during the holiday season, with November and December driving an average of **22% growth in both revenue and order volume**, underscoring the brand’s reliance on year-end consumer activity.

Monthly growth rate trends from 2019–2022 reveal clear signs of seasonal volatility and post-2020 normalization. Across all four years, February and October consistently show **declines in sales and order count by 23-31%**, indicating potential cyclical slowdowns in customer activity or promotional gaps during these periods. The 2020 surge stands out as a sharp anomaly, with rapid early-year expansion followed by contraction in Q4. However, subsequent years show a persistent decline in growth momentum, culminating in deeper drops during 2022.
